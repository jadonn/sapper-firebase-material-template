# Sapper Firebase Material Template
## What is this repository?
This repository is a skeleton application for making web applications using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), [Sapper Template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [Svelte Material UI](https://sveltematerialui.com/).

This skeleton was originally based off of the Sapper Rollup Template.

Compare this repo against the Sapper Rollup Template to see the exact modifications that were made.

This repo combines a good deal of work done by other people to figure out individually how to add Firebase and Material design into Svelte and Sapper. Thank you for your work!

### Login and Registration
This repository does have login and registration support implemented to a basic degree using Google Firebase and [Firebase UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web).

## Why this repository?
Firebase and Material UI take a bit of work to integrate into Sapper and Svelte. This repository is boilerplate code that should enable development using these tools easily and quickly. All of the minimum dependencies and requirements to use the libraries should be already included.

## How to use this repository?
Clone the repository, run `npm install` and put your Google Firebase configuration information into the `template.html` file in the top level of the `src` folder.

After the repository is setup, follow the normal development workflows outlined by Sapper, Firebase, and Svelte Material UI.
